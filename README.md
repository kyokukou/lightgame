# lightgame

Untiy prototype game created as a team project. Demo video in repository, or game demo available here: https://weshowedup.github.io/WebDemo/

We created a 2D unity pixel game where you play as a light spirit wandering through a dark and scary world. Your light decreases over time making it harder to see the surrounding area and avoide enemies who are also trying to see your light. When you run out of light the game is over. Roam around the map gathering light crystals to survive while collecting coins, and keys to open treasure chests and advance. The in game shop can be used to buy abilites to enhance your capabilites. Compete to survive the longest and reach the highest score.
